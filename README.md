# Date Analyzer in Python

This is a simple project created as a practical exercise to strengthen fundamental Python skills through an easy-to-understand use case.

## What is a Leap Year?

A leap year is a year that contains an extra day, February 29th. This day is added to keep our calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year (the time it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun).

The calendar we commonly use, the Gregorian calendar, follows these specific rules to determine if a year is a leap year:

*   The year must be evenly divisible by 4.
*   However, if the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, UNLESS...
*   The year is also evenly divisible by 400. In that case, it IS a leap year.

For example, the year 2000 and 2024 are leap years, but 1900 was not.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to apply intermediate Python programming concepts to build a functional tool. It aims to move from basic theory (variables, loops) to a more organized and reusable code structure.

## Concepts Learned and Applied

Throughout this project, the following key Python concepts are put into practice:

*   **Modules**: The `datetime` module is used to interact with system dates and times, learning how to import and use existing functionalities.

*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: A class (`DateAnalyzer`) is defined to encapsulate the program's logic, grouping related functions (methods). Objects are created from this class to use its methods.

*   **Data Structures**:
    *   **Dictionaries**: Used to store information in a structured way (key-value pairs), making it easier to read and handle.
    *   **Lists**: Used to manage collections of data and are iterated through with `for` loops to apply the same logic to multiple items.

*   **Error Handling**: A `try-except` block is used to manage potential errors when the user inputs data, making the program more robust.

*   **Best Practices**: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct is used to ensure that the main code only runs when the script is executed as the main file.

## Project Purpose

This project has a dual purpose:

*   **Educational**: To serve as a hands-on exercise to solidify Python learning.

*   **Functional**: To create a simple console tool that can:
    *   Check if a given year is a leap year.
    *   Inform the user of the current week number.

This project demonstrates the ability to combine different language elements to build a coherent and functional application from scratch.

## Future Improvements and Final Thoughts

While the current features fulfill a specific personal learning requirement, this project has great potential for expansion. It serves as a solid foundation that can be built upon as new programming concepts are learned.

Some potential improvements could include:

*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Implementing a simple GUI using a library like `Tkinter` or `PyQt` to make the application more user-friendly.

*   **Expanded `datetime` Features**: Adding new functions, such as calculating the number of days between two dates or finding out the day of the week for a specific date.

*   **Interacting with APIs**: Connecting to a public API to fetch holidays for a given year and country.

*   **Saving Results**: Adding functionality to save the analysis results into a text file or a CSV.

In summary, this project is a starting point. The real value lies in its potential to grow and adapt, making it an excellent playground for testing and implementing new skills in Python.
